Maven settings are your local computer maven settings which are used to configure maven.
We will use them to add your custom database username and password. :)

To use local maven settings you need to put settings.xml file (example is attached) into ${user.home}/.m2/ directory.

To change database driver, url, username and password you need to simply modify properties "db.username" and "db.password".

Example: (check example included)
<settings>
[...]
    <db.driver-class>here insert db driver class</db.driver-class>
    <db.url>url for your db</db.url>
    <db.username>customUsername</db.username>
    <db.password>customPassword</db.password>
[...]
</settings>

-------------------------
Please do not change the names of the properties!
We use them in our pom.xml and will stop working properly.

I have included settings.xml with default settings to mysql and postgres db.
